        "### Applying TF-IDF Vectorization to Address Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have a detailed understanding of TF-IDF, we can apply this technique to our address data. The purpose of the previous TF-IDF code was to explain how the method works under the hood. For obtaining the results, the few lines of code below are sufficient to calculate the TF-IDF matrix for both the original addresses (training set) and the modified addresses (test set). The following steps illustrate how we initialize the TF-IDF Vectorizer, fit it to our original addresses, and transform both the original and modified addresses into TF-IDF matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize the TF-IDF Vectorizer**:\n",
        "   - We start by creating an instance of `TfidfVectorizer`. This object will be used to convert our text data into TF-IDF features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fit and Transform the Original Addresses**:\n",
        "   - The `fit_transform` method is applied to the original addresses (`df_all_addresses['address']`). This step will directly give us the TF-IDF matrix for the original address data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transform the Modified Addresses**:\n",
        "   - Using the already fitted vectorizer, we transform the modified addresses (`df_modified_addresses['address']`). This step uses the learned vocabulary and IDF to convert the modified addresses into a TF-IDF matrix. It is important to note that we don't fit the vectorizer on the modified addresses. In other words, we are not calculating the importance value of those terms that only exist in the modified version (test set) and consider it as zero. A TF-IDF value of zero means that the term does not contribute to the document vector in the transformed space. This neutrality ensures that new terms do not introduce any bias or noise into the similarity calculation. Essentially, the similarity is calculated based only on the shared vocabulary learned from the original data.\n",

        "By performing these steps, we convert our textual address data into numerical TF-IDF representations. These representations can then be used for further analysis, such as comparing the similarity between original and modified addresses using cosine similarity.\n",

        "Cosine similarity is a metric used to determine how similar two documents are, regardless of their size. It calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which in our case, are the TF-IDF representations of the addresses. Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**:\n",
        "   - Cosine similarity is calculated by dividing the dot product of the vectors by the product of their magnitudes. This results in a value between -1 and 1.\n",
        "   - **Value of 1**: This indicates that the vectors are identical in direction, meaning the documents (addresses) are very similar.\n",
        "   - **Value of 0**: This indicates that the vectors are orthogonal, meaning the documents have no terms in common and are completely different.\n",
        "   - **Value of -1**: This indicates that the vectors are diametrically opposed, meaning they are completely dissimilar.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dot Product**:\n",
        "   - The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements. For example, for vectors A and B, the dot product is the sum of the products of their corresponding values.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Magnitude**:\n",
        "   - The magnitude (or length) of a vector is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its elements. This gives a measure of the vector's length in multidimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `cosine_similarity(tfidf_modified, tfidf_all)` function in scikit-learn calculates the cosine similarity between each pair of vectors in the input matrices. The result of `cosine_similarity(tfidf_modified, tfidf_all)` is a matrix where each element (i, j) represents the cosine similarity between the i-th vector in tfidf_modified and the j-th vector in tfidf_all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cosine similarity is particularly useful for text analysis because it is invariant to the length of the documents. This means that it focuses on the orientation (direction) of the vectors rather than their magnitude, making it ideal for comparing documents of different lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using cosine similarity, we can measure how similar the modified addresses are to the original addresses based on their TF-IDF representations. This helps in identifying the most similar original address for each modified address, providing insights into how the addresses have changed."

Implementing Levenshtein distance will help us account for minor spelling variations and typos. Using Jaccard similarity can measure the overlap between sets of words in the addresses. Combining multiple similarity measures, such as TF-IDF with cosine similarity, Levenshtein distance, and Jaccard similarity, can provide a more robust matching algorithm.\n",

This method can be useful in various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks where maintaining the integrity of textual data is crucial."
